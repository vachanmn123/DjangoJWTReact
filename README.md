My attempt to learn JWT authentication using django as a backend and reactJS for the frontend.

## Backend
The code for the backend is in the `backend/` folder. Run it using `python3 manage.py runserver`.  

## Frontend
The code for the react frontend is in the `frontend/` folder. Run it using `npm run dev`.
